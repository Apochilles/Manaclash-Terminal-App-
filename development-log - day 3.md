##                       Update 9 am - Friday the 6th of September 


At about 3 pm yesterday I decided my features were too extensive to be able to finish my app and my documentation on time.

My first feature, Create a new card, is complete so this will remain. 

My second feature which was meant to allow the user to edit their cards has been scrapped and I have decided to simplify my feature. My new new Export feature takes the attributes determined by user input and writes them into my attached CSV file.

My third feature was meant to be stripping a row of values from my csv. It is now a Display Card feature which allows the user to read the attached CSV containing their constructed cards and the sample Manaclash cards I have previously made.

I am disappointed I couldn't achieve my goals but I have over extended and am not left without a choice.
