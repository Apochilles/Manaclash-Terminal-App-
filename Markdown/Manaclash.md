## Purpose: 

Made with the intent to express my understanding with fundamental Ruby concepts while referencing something that I am familiar with. I’m building it with the express intention to build on the frame work once I have more time and a greater understanding of Ruby and App development.

The user experience is intended a fun and creative way to come up with some collectible cards. The presentation will utilize graphical gems to enrich the viewers aesthetic needs which still being user friendly and creative 
 
## Functionality:

The app will have the ability to create, edit and remove cards from a set of fictional collectible cards called “MANACLASH”

From the home screen the user will have three options “create”, “edit” and “remove” If you access the ‘edit’ or ‘remove’  command before creating any new cards I will have some place holding cards to effect. Otherwise, if you go straight to “create” you will be given the opportunity to apply attributes to a template. At any point you can cancel out of this screen and return to the main menu. Also there will  be some strict options for choices and if you put in something random it will kick you back until you input acceptable information. Once the card is created it will push to the CSV and can be effected by ‘edit’ and ‘remove’
