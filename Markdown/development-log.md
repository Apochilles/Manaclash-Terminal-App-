I have just finished a key element of my code. I how have a Class method that produces an object that represents a card with attributes assigned via user input. There is the issue that my code isn't as dry as I'd hoped it would be but streamlining can come later  
 
There is still much to go so I have decided to dedicate today to finishing my code and leave documentation to be finalized tomorrow. 
 
My remaining code for the day is as follows: I need to find a way to export my class object to a CSV. I then need to be able to remove those cards from the CSV. Then, I need to find a way to edit the CSV to change the attributes of the cards.
 
Finally I need a home screen that lists these options and present this in an attractive format 

Tomorrow I will message around the same time with an update on my progress.
