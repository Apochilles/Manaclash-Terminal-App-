Manaclash! You are the creator: is an application that allows the user to produce cards from the collectible card game of the same name and amass them into their own personal database of cards that can be viewed through the app at anytime. 

My create feature allows the user to name and describe a creature or spell of their choice and assign them attributes from a list of abilities.

My export feature takes the attributes determined by user input and writes them into my attached CSV file.

Once the user has experimented with creating cards they can view them with the ‘display card’ feature which allows the user to read the attached CSV containing their constructed cards and the sample premade Manaclash cards I have previously made.



It’s all well and good to play around with different systems of collectible card games but they never give you the opportunity to be creative with designs. My ‘create card’ feature allows the user to be as expressive as they want within the confines of these rules and save their creations for future reference and sharing.

My app was developed on my belief that card games are developing out the physical realm and into a digital platform that is more economical and more portable. 

My target audience is those who enjoy collectible card games such as Magic the Gathering, Yugi-oh and Pokemon. People who enjoy these kinds of games don’t often stick to a brands as they enjoy learning new rule sets and systems so I think my game would excite them. My target audience also includes creative people who enjoy messing around and creating funny make believe spells and creatures. 

I believe my core audience will mainly use it casually. Most likely when they don’t have physical cards handy or just feel like diving into a fresh experience on the go.
