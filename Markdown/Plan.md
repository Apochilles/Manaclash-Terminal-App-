# Terminal App: MANACLASH
 
## Develop a statement of purpose and scope for your application. It must include:

## describe at a high level what the application will do

#### My application will take a database of cards with attributes and 'add', 'edit' and 'remove' the cards  

## identify the problem it will solve and explain why you are developing it

#### The problem it will solve: 

## identify the target audience 

#### Geeks, people with limited time and resources 

## explain how a member of the target audience will use it

#### They will run a compiled file which will have my gems, CSV and Ruby code inside it 


# Develop a list of features that will be included in the application. It must include:
## at least THREE features

## Ensure that your features include the following language elements and concepts:
### use of variables and the concept of variable scope 
### loops and conditional control structures
### error handling

#### Note: If the features you described do not require you to use all of the above it is likely that your application is not sophisticated enough. Consult with your educator to check your features are sufficient to address the criteria for T1A2-7

## describe each feature

#### Feature one "Add card" - If you select this option you will determine the attributes of an object variable through user input and out a new card into the card list csv with a corresponding sound effect.

#### Feature two "Edit card" - If you select this option you will edit the attributes of a variable object through user input and the revised card will be added to the card list with a corresponding sound effect.

#### Feature three "Remove card" - If you select this option you will just be given a list of card titles from the csv and you can select one to remove the variable from the csv with a corresponding sound effect.

#### Feature four "Exit" - If you select this option there will be a sound effect and the app will close.

#### These features will work within a looped menu. When you run the app a graphic will display and 3 options will be give to you on the screen. After you utilize a feature it will return to you back to the main menu and the cycle will continue until you decide you quit. 


# Develop an outline of the user interaction and experience for the application.
## Your outline must include:
### how the user will find out how to interact with / use each feature

#### The app will run the screen will display a graphic displaying 

### "MANACLASH - YOU are the CREATOR"

#### Followed by 4 option listed from 1 - 4 
##### "Create"
##### "Edit"
##### "Remove"
##### "Quit"

#### The user will interact using (1-4) keys of the keyboard. Any other input will give you no response. 

### how the user will interact with / use each feature
### how errors will be handled by the application and displayed to the user

# Develop a diagram which describes the control flow of your application. Your diagram must:
### show the workflow/logic and/or integration of the features in your application for each feature.
### utilise a recognised format or set of conventions for a control flow diagram, such as UML.

# Develop an implementation plan which:
### outlines how each feature will be implemented and a checklist of tasks for each feature
### prioritise the implementation of different features, or checklist items within a feature
### provide a deadline, duration or other time indicator for each feature or checklist/checklist-item

#Write TWO status updates on your application. You must write a status update when:
### you significantly change a feature or your implementation plan at any point
### encounter a significant issue, challenge or roadblock
### are halfway through implementing the features
###  prior to / after testing the application

# Implement all features in the software development plan you have designed. You must utilise a range of programming concepts and structures using Ruby such as:
### variables and variable scope
### loops and conditional control structures
### write and utilise simple functions
### error handling
### input and output
### command line arguments
### importing a Ruby Gem
### using functions from a Ruby Gem

# Apply DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself) coding principles to all code produced.

# Apply all style and conventions for the programming language consistently to all code produced.

# Creates an application which runs without error and has features that are consistent with the development plan.

# Design a help file which includes a set of instructions which accurately describe how to use and install the application. 

## You must include:
### - steps to install the application
### - any dependencies required by the application to operate
### - any system/hardware requirements
### - a written explanation of the different features of the application

# Design TWO tests which check that the application is running as expected. 

## Each test should:
### - cover a different feature of the application
### - state what is being tested
### - provide at least TWO test cases and the expected results for each test case

# Utilise source control throughout the development of the application by:
### - making regular commits (at least 20 commits) with a commit message that summarises the changes
### - pushing all commits to a remote repository

# Utilise a project management platform to track the development of the application by:
### - having features itemised and broken down into checklists
### - setting deadlines, duration or a time-frame for each feature or task
###  prioritising tasks

#U tilise developer tools to automate the building and testing of the application by:
### - writing a script which runs the tests
### - writing a script which turns the application into an executable; OR
### - packaging the application for use as a module or dependency

# Presentation 

### present the terminal application to the class. You must provide a walk-through of the logic of your application and how the application is used. The time limit for your presentation is 5 minutes.
